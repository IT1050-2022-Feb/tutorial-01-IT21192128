/*Exercise 2 - Selection

Write a program to calculate the amount to be paid for a rented vehicle.

•	Input the distance the van has travelled
•	The first 30 km is at a rate of 50/= per km.
•	The remaining distance is calculated at the rate of 40/= per km.


e.g.

Distance -> 20
Amount = 20 x 50 = 1000


Distance -> 50
Amount = 30 x 50 + (50-30) x 40 = 2300*/

#include <stdio.h>

int main() 
  
  {
  float dist,amount;

  printf("\nEnter the dis(km):");
  scanf("%f",dist);

  if(dist<=30&& dist>0){
    amount=(float) dist*50;
  }
  else if (dist>30){
    amount=(float) (30*50)+((dist-30)*40);
  }

  printf("\nAmount=%.2f",amount);

  
  return 0;
}
